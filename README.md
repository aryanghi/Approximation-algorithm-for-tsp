## Introduction
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known problem in optimization, where the objective is to find the shortest route to visit all cities and return to the starting point. This project implements both **deterministic** and **approximation algorithms** for TSP, alongside a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of interaction.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Exact Algorithms**:
   - **Brute Force (BF):** Computes all permutations of vertices to find the optimal tour.
   - **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Implements Held-Karpâ€™s algorithm to optimize the search.

2. **Approximation Algorithms**:
   - **MST-Based Algorithm:** Converts a Minimum Spanning Tree into a TSP solution.
   - **Enhanced Approximation:** Implements improvements to the basic MST-based approach.(Read:https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/1/177)

## Features
- **Flexible Input Format:** Accepts graph data from a text file.
- **Modular Implementation:** Cleanly separated algorithms for easier understanding and extension.
- **Tkinter GUI:** Simple, intuitive interface to visualize the TSP graph and its solution.

---

## Input Format

The input is a text file (`input.txt`) where each line represents an edge in the graph in the following format:
```plaintext
u v w
```
Here:
- `u`: The starting vertex of the edge.
- `v`: The ending vertex of the edge.
- `w`: The cost (weight) of traveling from `u` to `v`.

Example:
```plaintext
1 2 10
2 3 15
3 1 20
```

## Usage

### Running the C++ Implementation
1. Navigate to the `src` directory and compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o tsp_solver main.cpp
   ```
2. Run the executable with the input file:
   ```bash
   ./tsp_solver input.txt
   ```

### Running the Python GUI
1. Navigate to the `gui` directory:
   ```bash
   cd gui
   ```
2. Run the GUI script:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

Hint

If you are solving large datasets, disable the exact algorithms (Brute Force and Dynamic Programming) before compilation to improve performance. These algorithms are suitable only for small to medium-sized inputs due to their high computational complexity.
